Avoid the Latin abbreviations eg, ie, etc (et cetera) and nb. 

[Don't use italics for Latin]({{ site.baseurl }}/formatting/#italics).

###eg

Use ‘for example’ instead of ‘eg’. If space is limited, for example in a table, you can use &#8217;eg&#8217;. Only do this if your users can understand it (sometimes screen readers won’t read it correctly).

###ie

Avoid using ‘that is’ or ‘meaning’ as an alternative to ‘ie’. Rewrite and restructure your content instead.

###etc

Use ‘and so on’ instead of ‘etc’ only when you really must, or restructure the sentence to say something like ‘Examples include a, b and c’, as the reader should not be left to guess what might or might not be on your list. 

###nb

Do not use nb (nota bene, or ‘note well’).
